## Getting Started

Demo hosted on: https://shielded-shelf-51374.herokuapp.com/

Clone / download a zip file. If you download a zip, unzip the package. Run node (nodemon) server. Run 'npm install --save" to acquire all packages needed to run the app/server. Then go to localhost:3000 in your web browser to experience seemē.

At first, you will have no users in the database, so you can simply sign up a few fake users, record videos for them by click on the "profile icon" in their profile page. Simply follow the intuitive UI to play around.

### Prerequisities

----
- All prerequisites in package.json. Simply run npm install --save to install all necessary packages
- SLACK MIKE FOR FIRBASE LOGIN CREDENTIALS - to review firebase storage
----

## Built With

* VS CODE (mainly), SUBLIME 
* Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator for some icons, and visuals  

## Walk throughs of code
Most of our routes, utilize helpers (found in /helpers) to shorten our route code, and make it a little more difficult to understand if you're trying to steal code ;)

An ajax call was used in recordvideo.js to send video url's (retrieved from firbase) to a route where our app could retrieve and store in mySQL
